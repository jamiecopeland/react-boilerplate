#### Hot loading
Run the dev server with Webpack's [hot module replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) and [react hot loader](with https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) for automagical app updates without a browser refresh everytime you change a file.  
```npm run startHot```

#### Full refresh
Run the dev server with app updates via a browser refresh everytime you change a file.  
```npm run startRefresh```

## Production
